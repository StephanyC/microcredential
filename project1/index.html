            The Dominican Republic is the second largest caribbean country. The 
            country is known as hispaniola.This name was given to the island by 
            the colonizer, Christopher Colombus. Tainos of the island named the 
            island Ayiti. Ayiti means flower of the high land. The other side of
            the island known as Haiti kept the name the tainos named the island 
            centuries ago. Due to colonizers that came to the island, they 
            created a divide between dominicans and haitians that still 
            exist today. With all this being said, the dominican republic 
            is great place for hot climate, diverse people, and rich history.
